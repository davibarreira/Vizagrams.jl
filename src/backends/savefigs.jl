savesvg(plt::𝕋{Mark};filename::String, directory::String="./", height=400, pad=0)

Saves the graphic as an svg figure. The function wraps the whole graphic into an
svg tag with a given view height equal to `height` + `pad`. The `pad` is just
some white space added around the figure. The use of padding is recommended
in order to guarantee that the image is fully displayed.

some white space added around the figure. The use of padding is recommended
in order to guarantee that the image is fully displayed. For raster images
